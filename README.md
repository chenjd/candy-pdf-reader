Introduction
------------

The goal of this project is to build a PDF (Portable Document Format) reader application based on Mozilla PDF.js and node-webkit. 

[PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) is a Javascript library as well as a lightweight viewer that can parse and render PDF files using HTML5.  With [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit), the library is built into an nw package from which an executable file is generated so that it can be distributed and launched as a standalone native app without a browser.

Current implementation is based on PDF.js v0.5.5 and note-webkit v0.8.1.
