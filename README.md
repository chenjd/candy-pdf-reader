Introduction
============

The goal of this project is to build a PDF (Portable Document Format) reader application based on Mozilla PDF.js and node-webkit. [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) is a Javascript library as well as a lightweight viewer that can parse and render PDF files using HTML5. With [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit), the library is built into a nw package from which the executable file is generated that can be distributed and launched as a standalone native app without a browser.
